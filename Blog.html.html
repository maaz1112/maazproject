                <h2>Our Facilities And Online Program For 2024</h2>
                <p>Certainly!

                    Welcome to IT Tech University, where excellence meets innovation in our cutting-edge programs
                    designed to shape the leaders of tomorrow. As we stride into 2024, our commitment to providing
                    world-class facilities remains unwavering.

                    Our state-of-the-art campus is equipped with the latest technology, creating an immersive learning
                    environment for students pursuing various programs. From modern lecture halls to specialized
                    laboratories, we ensure that our facilities align with the evolving demands of the tech industry.

                    The heart of our academic prowess lies in our faculty, a dynamic blend of seasoned professionals and
                    forward-thinking researchers. They not only impart knowledge but also mentor students to navigate
                    the complexities of the tech landscape, preparing them for real-world challenges.

                    Moreover, our commitment to fostering a vibrant student community is evident in the myriad of
                    extracurricular activities and clubs available. Whether it's hackathons, coding competitions, or
                    industry networking events, students have ample opportunities to broaden their horizons beyond the
                    classroom.

                    Looking forward to 2024, we are investing in expanding our research centers and collaborative
                    spaces. These initiatives aim to create hubs of innovation where students can engage in
                    interdisciplinary projects, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the tech realm.

                    At IT Tech University, our vision extends beyond traditional education. We strive to cultivate not
                    just graduates but future leaders who are adept at navigating the ever-evolving tech landscape. Join
                    us in 2024 as we continue to push boundaries, redefine education, and empower the tech leaders of
                    tomorrow.</p><br>

                    Hell I would hire someone that could grok Python and just write documentation. I don't even need
                    them to understand it. Turn my trash into perfectly valid Google Style documentation. That would
                    take a huge weight off of my shoulders and improve code around the company. Maybe they might pick up
                    some Python on the way. That's the sort of work that tradesmen give to the grunt apprentices.
                    Doctors have moved to train physician assistants, RNs, and a host of other positions to do most of
                    their job so they can concentrate on what they were trained to do.

                    As long as the gray beards insist that the only people that can replace them have BS degrees then
                    the company will find the cheapest "BS" degree they can and hire them. Mechanical engineers have had
                    mechanical engineering technologists for a while and they're amazing. It would take me twice as long
                    to do something they do and it would be half as good. It doesn't mean I don't have a job it means I
                    get to concentrate on the engineering.

                    If you want to see CS and IT shift back to the US then you need to sell your manager on hiring 16
                    year olds to do your tedious work so that you can concentrate on the hard bits of it. And when those
                    hard bits become the tedious bits, train them and move on. Rinse and repeat. If you're a manager
                    looking for 'cheap labor' start talking to the local voctech high schools. Factor in rework and
                    communication 'costs' and pay them well for their age. You'll come out loads ahead. They'll have
                    relevant job experience for the future and you'll have cheap labor. If you have someone set to
                    retire in 5 years just have the 16 year olds shadow them and do any work that they can
                </p>
